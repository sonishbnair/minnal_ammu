Achaa, their teacher, had challenged them to a game.\n\nAmmu flew into the air, landing gracefully near midfield. She kicked the ball so fast it vanished in a flash of light. Sid, quick as lightning, chased after it, dribbling skillfully towards Achaa's goal.\n\nSuddenly, dark clouds gathered overhead. \"No rain today!\" Ammu thought, and she moved the clouds aside, making the sun shine again. But then, just as Sid was about to score, it started raining! Ammu panicked but remembered her other power: stopping rains. She moved the clouds over the soccer ground, ending the downpour.\n\nWith a final sprint, Sid scored, making everyone cheer. They hugged Achaa, who smiled and said, \"Remember, teamwork makes the dream work!\"",
